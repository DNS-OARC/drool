.TH drool 1 "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "DNS Replay Tool"
.SH NAME
drool \- DNS Replay Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drool command
[
.I options
] <
.I arguments
>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B drool
can replay DNS traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send
it to a specified server, with options such as to manipulate the timing
between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set number
of iterations.
This tool's goal is to be able to produce a high amount of UDP packets per
second and TCP sessions per second on common hardware.

The purpose can be to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
on the DNS and measure normal DNS querying.
For example, the tool could enable you to take a snapshot of a DDoS and be
able to replay it later to test if new code or hardening techniques are
useful, safe & effective.
Another example is to be able to replay a packet stream for a bug that is
sequence- and/or timing-related in order to validate the efficacy of
subsequent bug fixes.
