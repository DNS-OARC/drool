.TH drool 1 "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "DNS Replay Tool"
.SH NAME
drool \- DNS Replay Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drool respdiff
[
.I options
]
.B path
.B name
.B file
.B name
.B host
.B port
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is to be used in conjunction with the tool-chain
.I respdiff
by CZ.NIC (see
.IR https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/knot/respdiff ).
.LP
It will replay DNS queries found in the PCAP, but only if a correlating
response is also found, against the target
.I host
and
.IR port .
The query, original response and the received response is then stored into
a LMDB database located at
.IR path .
The
.I name
before the PCAP
.I file
and the
.I name
before the target
.I host
are stored in the meta table which should correspond with the configuration
use for
.I respdiff
in order for it to be able to read the results correctly.
.SH OPTIONS
These options are specific for the
.B respdiff
command, see
.IR drool (1)
for generic options.
.TP
.B \-D
Show DNS queries and responses as processing goes.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-tcp
Do not use TCP.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-udp
Do not use UDP.
.TP
.B \-T \-\-threads
Use threads.
.TP
.B \-\-tcp\-threads N
Set the number of TCP threads to use, default 2.
.TP
.B \-\-udp\-threads N
Set the number of UDP threads to use, default 4.
.TP
.B \-\-timeout N.N
Set timeout for waiting on responses [seconds.nanoseconds], default 10.0.
.TP
.B \-\-size BYTES
Set the size (in bytes, multiple of OS page size) of the LMDB database, default 10485760.
.SH DATABASE SIZE
Note that you will need to set a database size that is large enough for all
queries, all original responses, all received responses and all analysis done
by
.I respdiff
tool-chain in order for a successful analysis to be done.
.SH EXAMPLE
This example replays a PCAP file against localhost and then uses the
.I respdiff
tool-chain to analyze the results.
