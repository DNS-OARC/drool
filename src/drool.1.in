.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdrool\fR can replay DNS traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send
it to a specified server, with options such as to manipulate the timing
between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set number
of iterations.
This tool's goal is to be able to produce a high amount of UDP packets per
second and TCP sessions per second on common hardware.

The purpose can be to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
on the DNS and measure normal DNS querying.
For example, the tool could enable you to take a snapshot of a DDoS and be
able to replay it later to test if new code or hardening techniques are
useful, safe & effective.
Another example is to be able to replay a packet stream for a bug that is
sequence- and/or timing-related in order to validate the efficacy of
subsequent bug fixes.

Most of the functionality of this tool is controlled by the configuration
used, please see
.BR drool.conf (5)
for more information.
.SH DESIGN

  input -> context -+-> client pool -> target
                    +-> client pool -> target
                    +-> client pool -> target

Each file read or interface listen on is a context and runs in its own
thread, parses the input for DNS queries and puts them into a queue within
the context.

Each context can have one or more client pools.

Each client pool runs in its own thread, waits for DNS queries on the context
queue and sends them to the target.
.SH CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION LIMITATIONS
See
.BR drool.conf (5)
for the current implementation limitations that exists.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR [\fItype\fR:]\fIconfig\fR
Specify the configuration to use, if no \fItype\fR is given then
\fIconfig\fR expects to be a file.
Valid types are \fBfile\fR and \fBtext\fR.
Can be given multiple times and will be processed in the given order.
See
.BR drool.conf (5)
for configuration syntax.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIfacility\fR[:\fIlevel\fR]
Enable logging for \fIfacility\fR, optional log \fIlevel\fR can be given
to enable just that.
Can be given multiple times and will be processed in the given order.
See LOGGING for more information.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR \fIfacility\fR[:\fIlevel\fR]
Disable logging for \fIfacility\fR, optional log \fIlevel\fR can be given
to disable just that.
Can be given multiple times and will be processed in the given order.
See LOGGING for more information.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfilter\fR
Set the Berkeley Packet Filter to use.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIinterface\fR
Capture packets from interface, can be given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIfile.pcap\fR
Read packets from PCAP file, can be given multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR \fImode\fR
Specify the mode for reading PCAP files, see READ MODES for available modes.
.TP
.\" \fB\-o\fR \fIinterface\fR
.\" todo
.\" .TP
.\" \fB\-w\fR \fIfile.pcap\fR
.\" todo
.\" .TP
.B \-n
Dry run mode, do not allocate any outbound sockets or generate any
network traffic.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose, a simple way to enable logging.
Can be given multiple times to increase verbosity level.
.TP
.B \-h
Print help and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.SH LOGGING
Logging is enabled and disabled in the order specified on the command line
which allows for enabling of all logging and disabling of specific, for
example:

  drool -l all -L network:debug

The following logging facilities exists:
.TP
\fBcore\fR
Log messages about initializing, configuration and start up.
.TP
\fBnetwork\fR
Log messages about network related tasks.
.TP
\fBall\fR
Log messages for all facilities, this is only used to configure logging.
.LP
The following logging level exists for all facilities:
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
Log messages about the very inner workings, use with caution since it
generates a lot of messages.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR
Log messages of the informational kind that may not be interesting in normal
operation.
.TP
\fBnotice\fR
Log messages of the informational kind that may be interesting in normal
operation.
.TP
\fBwarning\fR
Log message of the warning kind that indicates possible disruption in
operation.
.TP
\fBerror\fR
Log messages of the error kind that will most likely result in termination
of operation.
.TP
\fBcritical\fR
Log messages of the critical kind that indicates termination of operation.
.TP
\fBall\fR
Log messages for all levels, this is only used to configure logging.
.SH READ MODES
.TP
\fBloop\fR
Loop the given file(s) until interrupted.
.TP
\fBiter\fR:\fInumber\fR
Iterate the given file(s) for \fInumber\fR of times.
.SH EXITING
\fBdrool\fR will exit once processing of PCAP files is complete or if
interrupted (CTRL-C or SIGINT).
If any interface is being processed or if loop read mode is being used,
then \fBdrool\fR must be interrupted in order to exit.

\fBdrool\fR can be forcefully exited by interrupting (CTRL-C or SIGINT) twice.
.SH EXIT VALUES
0 \- no error
.br
1 \- generic error
.br
2 \- unknown or invalid option
.br
3 \- conf file error
.br
4 \- signal setup or handling error
.br
5 \- signal received
.br
6 \- pcap-thread error
.br
7 \- out of memory
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fBdrool \-vv \-c 'text:timing multiply 0.5; client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53"; client_pool sendas udp;' \-r file.pcap\fR

Send all DNS queries twice as fast as found in the PCAP file to localhost
using UDP.
.TP
\fBdrool \-vv \-c 'text:filter "tcp"; client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53";' \-r file.pcap\fR

Only look for DNS queries in TCP traffic and send it to localhost.
.TP
\fBdrool \-vv \-c 'text:filter "port 53"; client_pool target "172.16.1.2" "53";' \-i eth0\fR

Listen for DNS queries on eth0 and send them to an (assuming) internal server.
.TP
\fBdrool \-vv \-c 'text:filter "udp"; timing ignore; context client_pools 5; client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53"; client_pool skip_reply;' \-r file.pcap\fR

Take all UDP DNS queries found in the PCAP file and send them as fast as
possible to localhost by ignoring both timings, replies and starting 5
contexts (threads) that will simultaneously send queries.
