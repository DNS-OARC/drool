# DNS Replay Tool (drool)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DNS-OARC/drool.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/DNS-OARC/drool) [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/12202/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/dns-oarc-drool)

`drool` can replay DNS traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send
it to a specified server, with options such as to manipulate the timing
between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set number
of iterations. This tool's goal is to be able to produce a high amount
of UDP packets per second and TCP sessions per second on common hardware.

The purpose can be to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
on the DNS and measure normal DNS querying. For example, the tool could
enable you to take a snapshot of a DDoS and be able to replay it later
to test if new code or hardening techniques are useful, safe & effective.
Another example is to be able to replay a packet stream for a
bug that is sequence- and/or timing-related in order to validate the
efficacy of subsequent bug fixes.

## Usage example

This example reads all DNS queries from a PCAP file, sends them to
a nameserver at `127.0.0.1` and ignores both timings and replies.

```
drool \
  -vv \
  -c 'text:timing ignore;' \
  -c 'text:client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53";' \
  -c 'text:client_pool skip_reply;' \
  -r file.pcap
```

## Dependencies and build tools

`drool` requires the PCAP library and the event engine EV along with system
build tools.

To install the dependencies and build tools under Debian 8+/Ubuntu 14.04+:
```
apt-get install -y libpcap-dev libev-dev build-essential autoconf automake libtool
```

To install the dependencies and build tools under CentOS 7+ (with EPEL enabled):
```
yum install -y libpcap-devel libev-devel
yum group install -y "Development Tools"
```

To install the dependencies, build tools and setup the environment for
FreeBSD 11+ using `pkg`:
```
pkg install -y libpcap libev gmake autoconf automake libtool gcc
export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 \
  AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 \
  CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
```

For OpenBSD 6.0+ it is recommended to install a later version of the PCAP
library then the system provides, rest of the dependencies can be installed
using `pkg_add` (based on 6.0, package versions may be different for others):
```
pkg_add libev gcc autoconf-2.69p2 automake-1.15p0 gmake-4.2.1 libtool-2.4.2p0
export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 \
  AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 \
  CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
```
