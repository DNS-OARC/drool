# DNS Replay Tool (drool)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DNS-OARC/drool.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/DNS-OARC/drool) [![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/12202/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/dns-oarc-drool)

`drool` can replay DNS traffic from packet capture (PCAP) files and send
it to a specified server, with options such as to manipulate the timing
between packets, as well as loop packets infinitely or for a set number
of iterations. This tool's goal is to be able to produce a high amount
of UDP packets per second and TCP sessions per second on common hardware.

The purpose can be to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
on the DNS and measure normal DNS querying. For example, the tool could
enable you to take a snapshot of a DDoS and be able to replay it later
to test if new code or hardening techniques are useful, safe & effective.
Another example is to be able to replay a packet stream for a
bug that is sequence- and/or timing-related in order to validate the
efficacy of subsequent bug fixes.

## Usage example

Send all DNS queries twice as fast as found in the PCAP file to localhost
using UDP:

```shell
drool -vv \
  -c 'text:timing multiply 2.0; client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53"; client_pool sendas udp;' \
  -r file.pcap
```

Only look for DNS queries in TCP traffic and send it to localhost:

```shell
drool -vv \
  -c 'text:filter "tcp"; client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53";' \
  -r file.pcap
```

Listen for DNS queries on eth0 and send them to an (assuming) internal server:

```shell
drool -vv \
  -c 'text:filter "port 53"; client_pool target "172.16.1.2" "53";' \
  -i eth0
```

Take all UDP DNS queries found in the PCAP file and send them as fast as
possible to localhost by ignoring both timings, replies and starting 5
contexts (threads) that will simultaneously send queries:

```shell
drool -vv \
  -c 'text:filter "udp"; timing ignore; context client_pools 5; client_pool target "127.0.0.1" "53"; client_pool skip_reply;' \
  -r file.pcap
```

## Timing warnings

The warnings from timing mode `keep` consists of:
- `process cost`: This is the CPU cost of processing the packet including the cost of measuring the cost
- `packet diff`: This is the timing differential between the previous packet and the packet being processed as seen from the PCAP, i.e. the time to wait before sending it
- `now`: Is the time "now" or at least when the processing for this packet begun
- `sleep to`: Was the time it should have slept to

The values for `now` and `sleep to` are in monotonic or real-time clock
depending on the available system functionality during compilation.

## Dependencies and build tools

`drool` requires the PCAP library and the event engine EV along with system
build tools.

To install the dependencies and build tools under Debian 8+/Ubuntu 14.04+:
```
apt-get install -y libpcap-dev libev-dev build-essential autoconf automake libtool
```

To install the dependencies and build tools under CentOS 7+ (with EPEL enabled):
```
yum install -y libpcap-devel libev-devel
yum group install -y "Development Tools"
```

To install the dependencies, build tools and setup the environment for
FreeBSD 11+ using `pkg`:
```
pkg install -y libpcap libev gmake autoconf automake libtool gcc
export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 \
  AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 \
  CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
```

For OpenBSD 6.0+ it is recommended to install a later version of the PCAP
library then the system provides, rest of the dependencies can be installed
using `pkg_add` (based on 6.0, package versions may be different for others):
```
pkg_add libev gcc autoconf-2.69p2 automake-1.15p0 gmake-4.2.1 libtool-2.4.2p0
export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 \
  AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15 \
  CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
```
