drool (1.1.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.1.0

    Rework of the timing code to make it more effective, based on
    proof-of-concept from Petr Špaček @pspacek (CZ.NIC).

    The `best_effort` timing mode is now deprecated, this is now the same
    mode as `keep` and the warnings `keep` made when unable to follow
    timings have been removed.

drool (1.0.0.alpha.3-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

    Release 1.0.0-alpha.3

    Reworked some of the client code to better handle stream sockets (TCP),
    retrys to send query if the system's sockets are exhausted.  Can send
    queries as the original protocol or force them into UDP or TCP.

    Default number of client pools running per context is now 1, increase
    this if you want to push UDP queries.  For TCP this has little effect
    since you will most likely hit system limits before that.

    Config changes:
    - Added `context client_pools num;`
    - Added `client_pool max_reuse_clients num;`
    - Added `client_pool sendas what;`

    Other changes:
    - Add timing details to warning about not keeping up with timings

drool (1.0.0.alpha.2-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

    Release 1.0.0-alpha.2

    This release implements the core engine and most of the network code
    which consists of:
    - parsing DNS packet from input using omg-dns
    - sending queries to a client pool using sllq
    - processing queries using client objects and libev event loops

    Handling results/responses have yet been implemented.

    - Added `-R` to specify read mode for PCAP files
    - Removed `-w` and `-o`

    Config changes:
    - Added `timing ignore;`
    - Added `timing keep;`
    - Added `timing add nanoseconds;`
    - Added `timing reduce nanoseconds;`
    - Added `timing multiply float;`, note: no logic added yet
    - Added `client_pool target "ip" "port";`
    - Added `client_pool max_clients num;`
    - Added `client_pool client_ttl float;`
    - Added `client_pool skip_reply;`
    - Removed `read`, `input`, `write` and `output`
